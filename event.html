    <h1>I host a LOT of events!</h1>
    
    <p>If you're interested in AI Safety I run 2-3 events a week out of <a href="https://www.trajectorylabs.org/">Trajectory Labs</a>. You can see our upcoming events <a href="https://luma.com/trajectory-labs?k=c">here</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Outside of my work, I try to host the following every month:</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>One open invite hangout (this could be a powerpoint night, a game show, a movie night, karaoke, or something else entirely. The vision is that people can hang out in a low-stakes large group environment without needing to spend money)</li>
        <li>One book club (usually the last Saturday evening of every month) where we meet to discuss 3-5 readings centered around a theme (like "love", "illness" or "wildness").</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="highlight">
        <p>If you're interested in attending my non-work events you can join <a href="https://discord.gg/KyxgzAzZju">this Discord server</a> or <a href="https://luma.com/calendar/cal-PJDIB6yCGK9kCdH">subscribe to this mailing list</a>.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>I am always open to hearing from people who have access to nice venues or good ideas for events they'd like my help hosting.</p>
