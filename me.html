<h1>about me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Georgia! <br>

I was born and raised in Windsor, Ontario. I moved to Waterloo and lived there for five years while getting my bachelors (in computer science with a joint major in English literature). <br>I currently lead ops at <a href="trajectorylabs.org">Trajectory Labs</a>, an AI safety nonprofit based in Toronto. <br>My previous work experience includes software engineering, journalism, publishing, event hosting, childcare, food service, and education. <br>In my free time I like to host events and parties, read, and write.
